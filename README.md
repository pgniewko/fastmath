DESCRIPTION
==================================================
The library implements Vector3D class ussing SSE.

The purpose of the library is testing the extent of optimization that can 
be done solely by _g++_ compiler and comapring it to the _in-house_ vectorization.

GETTING THE CODE
==================================================
* To get the code:
```
git@bitbucket.org:pawelgniewek/sse-vector3d.git
```

* To obtain the most recent version of the code:
```
git pull origin master
```

COMPILING - LINUX
==================================================
```
make
```

USAGE
=====
To run the test simply run in the command line:
```
./bin/vec_sse
```
